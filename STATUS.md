# Status of the challenge

## What works
* Finding the first part of the challenge, the single words, work.
* Single words are displayed in order of popularity to solve the challenge. I have tested against two new online puzzles. They are added to the repository as puzzle6 and puzzle7.
* A puzzle is defined as a YAML file that is parsed at the beginning.

## What does not work

## Running the app
* The application starts with: JumbleSolverApp.
* Logging is enabled using log4j.
* You can set it to 
  - `INFO` to just get the result of the game.
  - `DEBUG` to get information about what is going on, as well as timing information.
  - `TRACE` to finely print detailed information, including content of dataframes.
 
## Tweaking
* 

## What can be enhanced
* Performance.
